On 2009-10-05 the market price of Bitcoin is first established at $0.000764/BTC
by New Liberty Standard, the first Bitcoin exchange ($1.00 buys 1309.03 BTC.)
The exchange rate history is available at two archived pages:
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100428024753/http://newlibertystandard.wetpaint.com/page/2009+Exchange+Rate">first</a>,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100301174241/http://newlibertystandard.wetpaint.com/page/Exchange+Rate">second</a>.
Their last known exchange rate is $0.005472/BTC on 2010-03-02.
</p>

<p>
On 2010-04-25 the market price is established again at $0.003/BTC, using the daily
volume-weighted trading price of the second Bitcoin exchange,
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Market"
    >BitcoinMarket.com</a>
(<a href="https://api.bitcoincharts.com/v1/csv/bcmPPUSD.csv.gz"
    >PayPal USD trades</a>).
The owner, dwdollar, actually started operating it on
<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20.msg748#msg748"
    >2010-03-17</a>,
however trading data for the first few weeks is—to my knowledge—not available.
</p>

<p>
After 2010-07-18 the exchange rate is from the CoinDesk BPI v1 API
(<span style="font-size: xx-small;" class="word-wrap"><a href="https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/historical/close.json?start=2010-07-18&end=2022-05-17">https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/historical/close.json?start=2010-07-18&end=2022-05-17</a></span>).
</p>

<p>
After 2022-05-18 the BPI v1 API has gaps, so the exchange rate is from the <a href="https://indices.coindesk.com/indices">CoinDesk Bitcoin XBX index</a> (currently <span style="font-size: xx-small;" class="word-wrap">https://production.api.coindesk.com/v2/tb/price/values/BTC?interval=1d&amp;...</span>).
For a while I was pulling data from the "BPI v3 API" (<span style="font-size: xx-small;" class="word-wrap">https://www.coindesk.com/pf/api/v3/content/fetch/chart-api?query=...</span>) but it was disabled on 2024-11-24 so I switched to the Bitcoin XBX index URL.

All above comes originally from (and is still up-to-date at)
<span class="word-wrap"><a href="https://bitcoin.zorinaq.com/price"
>bitcoin.zorinaq.com/price</a></span>. Thank you, Marc!
</p>

<p>
See the <a href="datacompare.txt">diff</a>
and <a href="wgetcompare.txt">wgetcompare.txt</a>
between Zorinaq's data and this site.
</p>

<p>
The notable change compared to the original is that two ancient
datapoints were added and they show that the genesis block was mined
on 2009-01-03 and until 2009-10-04 (the day before the first
real price is recorded on this chart) the price was zero. This change
also nicely offsets the Y-axis values of the logarithmic chart
making it much more human-readable.
