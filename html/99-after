The market price of Bitcoin is established again on 2010-04-25 at $0.003/BTC, using the daily
volume-weighted trading price of the second Bitcoin exchange,
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Market"
    >BitcoinMarket.com</a>
(<a href="https://api.bitcoincharts.com/v1/csv/bcmPPUSD.csv.gz"
    >PayPal USD trades</a>).
The owner, dwdollar, actually started operating it on
<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20.msg748#msg748"
    >2010-03-17</a>,
however trading data for the first few weeks is—to my knowledge—not available.

The Bitcoin exchange rate for 2010-07-18 and later is from the

<hr>

<p>All above
comes originally from <a href="https://bitcoin.zorinaq.com/price"
>bitcoin.zorinaq.com/price</a>. Thank you, Marc!
</p>

<p>The notable change compared to the original is that two ancient
datapoints were added and they show that the genesis block was mined
on 2009-01-03 and until 2009-10-04 (the day before the first
real price is recorded on this chart) the price was zero. This change
also nicely offsets the Y-axis values of the logarithmic chart
making it much more human-readable.
