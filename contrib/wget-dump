On 2009-10-05 the market price of Bitcoin is first established at $0.000764/BTC
by New Liberty Standard, the first Bitcoin exchange ($1.00 buys 1309.03 BTC.)
The exchange rate history is available at two archived pages:
first,
second.
Their last known exchange rate is $0.005472/BTC on 2010-03-02.

On 2010-04-25 the market price is established again at $0.003/BTC, using the daily
volume-weighted trading price of the second Bitcoin exchange,
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Market"
    >BitcoinMarket.com
(<a href="https://api.bitcoincharts.com/v1/csv/bcmPPUSD.csv.gz"
    >PayPal USD trades).
The owner, dwdollar, actually started operating it on
<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20.msg748#msg748"
    >2010-03-17,
however trading data for the first few weeks is—to my knowledge—not available.

After 2010-07-18 the exchange rate is from the CoinDesk BPI v1 API
(https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/historical/close.json?start=2010-07-18&end=2022-05-17).

After 2022-05-18 the BPI v1 API has gaps, so the exchange rate is from the CoinDesk Bitcoin XBX index (currently https://production.api.coindesk.com/v2/tb/price/values/BTC?interval=1d&amp;...).
For a while I was pulling data from the "BPI v3 API" (https://www.coindesk.com/pf/api/v3/content/fetch/chart-api?query=...) but it was disabled on 2024-11-24 so I switched to the Bitcoin XBX index URL.

After 2025-02-07 there is no clear API where Coindesk publishes the XBX index, so I switched to the cryptocompare BTC price in USD, using the open price of each day (https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/v2/histoday?fsym=BTC&amp;tsym=USD&amp;limit=...).
