   On 2009-10-05 the market price of Bitcoin is first established at
   $0.000764/BTC by New Liberty Standard, the first Bitcoin exchange
   ($1.00 buys 1309.03 BTC.) The exchange rate history is available at two
   archived pages: [1]first, [2]second. Their last known exchange rate is
   $0.005472/BTC on 2010-03-02.

   On 2010-04-25 the market price is established again at $0.003/BTC,
   using the daily volume-weighted trading price of the second Bitcoin
   exchange, [3]BitcoinMarket.com ([4]PayPal USD trades). The owner,
   dwdollar, actually started operating it on [5]2010-03-17, however
   trading data for the first few weeks is—to my knowledge—not available.

   After 2010-07-18 the Bitcoin exchange rate is from the [6]CoinDesk BPI.

   The notable change compared to the original is that two ancient
   datapoints were added and they show that the genesis block was mined on
   2009-01-03 and until 2009-10-04 (the day before the first real price is
   recorded on this chart) the price was zero. This change also nicely
   offsets the Y-axis values of the logarithmic chart making it much more
   human-readable.
