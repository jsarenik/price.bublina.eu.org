   On 2009-10-05 the market price of Bitcoin is first established at
   $0.000764/BTC by New Liberty Standard, the first Bitcoin exchange
   ($1.00 buys 1309.03 BTC.) The exchange rate history is available at two
   archived pages: [1]first, [2]second. Their last known exchange rate is
   $0.005472/BTC on 2010-03-02.

   On 2010-04-25 the market price is established again at $0.003/BTC,
   using the daily volume-weighted trading price of the second Bitcoin
   exchange, [3]BitcoinMarket.com ([4]PayPal USD trades). The owner,
   dwdollar, actually started operating it on [5]2010-03-17, however
   trading data for the first few weeks is--to my knowledge--not
   available.

   After 2010-07-18 the exchange rate is from the CoinDesk BPI v1 API
   ([6]https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/historical/close.json?start=2010-07
   -18&end=2022-05-17).

   After 2022-05-18 the BPI v1 API has gaps, so the exchange rate is from
   the [7]CoinDesk Bitcoin XBX index (currently
   https://production.api.coindesk.com/v2/tb/price/values/BTC?interval=1d&
   ...). For a while I was pulling data from the "BPI v3 API"
   (https://www.coindesk.com/pf/api/v3/content/fetch/chart-api?query=...)
   but it was disabled on 2024-11-24 so I switched to the Bitcoin XBX
   index URL.
