   Price data begins on 2009-10-05 at $0.000764/BTC which is the earliest
   exchange rate published by [1]New Liberty Standard, the first Bitcoin
   exchange ($1.00 buys 1309.03 BTC.) The historical exchange rate for
   early 2010 is available at [2]this other archived page. The last known
   New Liberty Standard exchange rate is $0.005472/BTC on 2010-03-02.

   The market price of Bitcoin is established again on 2010-04-25 at
   $0.003/BTC, using the daily volume-weighted trading price of the second
   Bitcoin exchange, [3]BitcoinMarket.com ([4]PayPal USD trades). The
   owner, dwdollar, actually started operating it on [5]2010-03-17,
   however trading data for the first few weeks is—to my knowledge—not
   available.

   The Bitcoin exchange rate for 2010-07-18 and later is from the
   [6]CoinDesk BPI.
